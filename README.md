# This repo contains the presentations and the colab notebooks used in the 3-week 9-session webinar on Machine Learning and Neural Networks

> In this 3-week, 9-part, hands-on webinar, participants will gain a strong understanding of the basic principles of machine learning and neural networks. Each session, outlined below, will offer practical applications of machine learning models to image-based applications. Instructor Rajesh Sharma, of Walt Disney Animation Studios, will help participants build intuition around a topic and reinforce that with related mathematics. Youâ€™ll walk away with the ability to apply those foundations to engineering solutions using available tools.
